### Abstract factory pattern
- **Abstract Factory Design Pattern is used to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's also sometimes called a factory of factories**.

### when to use it
- The client is independent of how we create and compose the objects in the system.
- The system consists of multiple families of objects, and these families are designed to be used together.
- We need a run-time value to construct a particular dependency.
