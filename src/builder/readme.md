### Builder pattern
- The Builder Design Pattern is another creational pattern designed to deal with the construction of comparatively complex objects.
- **When the complexity of creating object increases, the Builder pattern can separate out the instantiation process by using another object (a builder) to construct the object**.
- This builder can then be used to create many other similar representations using a simple step-by-step approach.

### when to use it
- When the process involved in creating an object is extremely complex, with lots of mandatory and optional parameters.
- When an increase in the number of constructor parameters leads to a large list of constructors.
- When client expects different representations for the object that's constructed.
