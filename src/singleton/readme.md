### Singleton pattern
- Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
- Encapsulated "just-in-time initialization" or "initialization on first use".

### when to use it
- Application needs one, and only one, instance of an object. Additionally, lazy initialization and global access are necessary.
